# Hello github user!
This is my first HTML coding, with a little help from ChatGPT. 

Please be aware that this is something you wouldn't want to check the website or code. 

I chose GitHub Pages because Google Sites flagged a file as a virus, which is a false positive. 

I'm interested in learning HTML, so hooray! This is my first (horrible) HTML coding.
